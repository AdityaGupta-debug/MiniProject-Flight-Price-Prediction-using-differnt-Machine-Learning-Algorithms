✈️ Flight Price Detection
📌 About the Dataset
This dataset is focused on predicting the price of airline tickets based on various travel details like the airline, source, destination, and duration. It reflects real-world airline pricing strategies and helps explore how different factors impact flight prices. The dataset is ideal for regression-based machine learning tasks.

📊 Features
The dataset contains the following key features:

Airline – Name of the airline (e.g., IndiGo, Air India)

Date_of_Journey – The date of the journey

Source – City of departure

Destination – City of arrival

Route – Route taken by the flight

Dep_Time – Departure time

Arrival_Time – Arrival time

Duration – Total time of the flight

Total_Stops – Number of stops in the journey

Additional_Info – Miscellaneous information

Price – Target variable (flight price)

🧠 Models Used
I applied several regression models to predict the flight prices:

Linear Regression

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

📈 Best Performance: Among all models, the Random Forest Regressor gave the best performance in terms of accuracy and generalization.

🚀 Project Goals
